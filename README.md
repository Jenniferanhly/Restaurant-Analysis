# Restaurant-Analysis

# Project Overview:
This project involves analyzing a restaurant's sales data using SQL to uncover key business insights. By querying the data, we aim to provide actionable insights regarding customer behavior, menu performance, and operational efficiency. The project leverages SQL queries to explore the restaurant’s orders, menu items, revenue trends, and customer activity.
# DataSet:
Dataset used: https://mavenanalytics.io/data-playground?order=date_added%2Cdesc&page=3&pageSize=10

The dataset used in this project comes from a fictional restaurant database, which includes two key tables:

order_details: Contains information about individual orders placed at the restaurant, including:

order_details_id: Unique ID for each order detail.

order_id: Identifier for each order.

order_date: Date when the order was placed.

order_time: Time when the order was placed.

item_id: Identifier for the item ordered.

menu_items: Contains information about menu items, including:

menu_item_id: Unique ID for each menu item.

item_name: Name of the menu item.

category: Category (e.g., appetizer, main course) to which the item belongs.

price: Price of the menu item.

The SQL schema includes sample data for both orders and menu items.
# Project Objectives:
The main objectives of this project are:

To analyze the restaurant’s sales performance by evaluating revenue, order patterns, and menu popularity.

To understand customer behavior through ordering trends.

To provide insights into operational efficiency, including peak times for orders and item combinations.

To help the restaurant optimize its menu and pricing strategies.
# Conclusion:
This project demonstrates how SQL can be used to analyze restaurant sales data, uncovering valuable insights into customer behavior, sales trends, and operational performance. The queries can be adapted to real-world datasets to help restaurants make informed decisions regarding menu optimization, pricing strategies, and resource allocation.
